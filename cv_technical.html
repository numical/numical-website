    <h2>Profile
        <a href="#banner"><img src="cv/home.png" alt="return to Contents"/></a>
    </h2>
    <p>I am a rounded, commercially orientated technical team leader with over 20 years experience in the
        business of software development over a wide range of different industries.
    <p>I have written a lot of code, architected systems, led technical development teams onshore and offshore, and project managed.</p>
    <p>I view leadership as the opportunity to build high-functioning teams and to grow engineers.</p>
    <p>My core technical skills are enterprise open-source technologies in JavaScript and Java. I have applied these to
        all levels of the technical stack from User Interface to Database and under project management methodologies
        ranging from waterfall, through DSDM to agile approaches such as Scrum, Kanban and XP.<p>
    <p>Technically, I aspire to be that mythical beast, a genuine full-stack developer.</p>
    <p>I regard as core competences the soft skills of listening hard, communicating
        well, and motivating others. I work particularly well at the interface between business and technology. My main
        driver is always delivery.</p>

                I was a senior engineer in the 'Engage Me' lab. I acted as a 'first among equals' within the development
                engineers, responsible for much of the web UI and supporting middleware of Lloyd's Financial Planning

                I worked hard to share knowledge and to cultivate a collegiate, inclusive environment for technical
                work both within the lab and across the division.  I was continuously active in technical guilds,
                training courses and mentoring apprentices.

            <p>When I took time off my formal career to look after my pre-school kids, I decided to pivot my technical
                orientation
                from Java enterprise technologies to JavaScript and its burgeoning enterprise ecosystem. </p>
            <p>I learnt all
                aspects of this including UI libraries, MVC frameworks, server middleware, databases, test frameworks
                and build tools.
                To ensure
                I practised the techniques as well as learn the technologies I carried out various projects:

            <p>I ran two of the eleven teams within a Sky’s ‘Lightweight Services’ initiative to replace legacy CRM
                systems with
                a modular, service-based infrastructure serving modern web front-ends.</p>
            <p>The project used the latest agile tools and techniques, with individual teams given the flexibility to
                self-organise.
                Consequently, in response to a high and on-going support load, I ran one team using Kanban whilst the
                other, entirely
                development orientated team I ran using using traditional Scrum.</p>
            <p>I was also invited into the CRM-replacement architectural group as a technical expert and as a formal
                facilitator
                for meetings and workshops.</p>

        <section>
            I started as a developer on Vebnet's new version of the 'LifeLens' software platform on which it offers its
            core customer
            proposition. Through repeated contract extensions my role evolved into an application architect and team
            lead role
            with complete end-to-end technical responsibility for:
            <ul>
                <li>content management</li>
                <li>direct customer communications and document production</li>
                <li>exposing mainframe data</li>
            </ul>
            After Standard Life's takeover of Vebnet, much development moved offshore. I concluded my contract leading
            15 people across
            one offshore and two onshore teams.

            <p>Kraya Ltd. is a web design and support house that was expanding into full-scale development. They brought
                me in to
                help them escape ‘analysis paralysis’ on the architecture and redevelopment of the server-side of a
                consumer facing
                ticketing website for their primary customer.</p>
            <p> We developed a web-service based approach and investigated appropriate technologies for a fully
                clustered, large
                scale deployment. I supported set-up of the project, both tooling and management methodologies,
                developed the middleware
                architecture, and maintained a watching brief through early development.</p>

            <p>I was brought in to rescue development of the Marketing Approval Platform (MAP) project. This aimed to
                automate the
                workflow for generating new structured financial products, using a specialist technology, Eclipse
                RCP.</p>
            <p>The existing code had been developed by an inexperienced offshore team. My role was to support them and
                their code
                base through to temporary deployment, and to establish an onshore technical team to produce a more
                maintainable
                and flexible successor. I designed a new application architecture and oversaw development. This new
                codebase is
                now rolled out globally.</p>

            <p>Bright Grey sells financial protection products through web, telephone, fax and mail channels. This
                involves complex
                workflows with multiple interactions between telephony, IT and manual systems. I was employed to analyse
                the operations
                of the technical support team, and report on ways to improve these. I was also asked to investigate
                flaws and suggest
                fixes to the business processes.</p>
            <p> The most beneficial of these investigations was the case of ‘lost proposals’ – where incoming
                applications were simply
                lost to the systems. This was suspected but neither proof nor cause was known. I discovered that
                approximately
                2-3% of new business was being affected by this with severe impacts on service levels and customer
                perception.
                With director-level backing, I introduced procedural changes and technical fixes that guarantee that no
                proposals
                are now lost.</p>

            Spektra was an Edinburgh-based software house that focused on e-commerce in the financial sector. I
            alternated between being
            the technical lead on large, mainly web, development efforts and specialist architectural and ‘evangelical’
            assignments.

                <p>
                    I was tasked with defining the business requirements for linking multiple providers’ back-end
                    systems to provide a ‘single
                    customer view’ website. This lone consultancy role was expanded to defining the technical
                    specifications of the
                    full ETL process and then to leading the team developing the required middleware.</p>
                <p>The subsequent success of this helped promote Spektra as the principle developer of the website and
                    its distributed
                    fulfilment infrastructure. During this time I reprised a role I had previously carried out at
                    Vodafone as the
                    customer’s ‘champion’ during requirements gathering and later in partner negotiations.</p>
                <p>I ended up fulfilling three separate engagements at the client, the final time at the personal
                    request of its IT
                    director.

                <p>
                    I was the technical lead on an initiative between Spektra and Oracle to develop and publicise the
                    UK’s first home-grown demonstrator
                    of Oracle’s Trading Community Architecture (TCA).The TCA is a service offering centred around a
                    highly generic
                    and flexible Oracle database.</p>
                <p>Our brief was to tailor this for the financial services market, and to provide a compelling sales
                    case for it.
                    This required an understanding of the market and our potential customers’ drivers, as well as coping
                    with the
                    relatively tricky technical complexities we encountered.</p>
                <p>I led a team of four using ‘extreme programming’ (XP), an agile management methodology, to produce
                    the demonstrator,
                    and then partnered with sales personnel from both Oracle and Spektra to develop the proposition to
                    market.

                    Spektra sent a six man development team to a customer who could neither define their requirements
                    nor articulate their needs.
                </p>
                <p>I was sent in specifically to drive out requirements when it appeared as if the engagement might
                    fail.</p>
                <p> Through a series of workshops and pro-active technology demonstrations, we ultimately secured
                    several man-years
                    of work.

            <p>I worked my way up through programming to team leading to project management, settling into a regular
