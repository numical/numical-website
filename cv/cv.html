    <h2>Profile<a href="#contents"><img src="home.png" alt="return to Contents"/></a></h2>
<p>I am a rounded, commercially orientated technical architect and team lead with over 19 years experience of the business of software development in a wide range of different industries.
I have architected systems, led technical development teams onshore and offshore, and project managed.  My core technical skills are enterprise open-source technologies in Java and JavaScript.  I have applied these under project management methodologies ranging from traditional waterfall, through DSDM to modern agile approaches such as Scrum and XP.</p>
<p>In addition to my technical skills, I regard as core competences the soft skills of listening hard, communicating well, and motivating others.  I work particularly well at the interface between business and technology. My principle concern is delivery.</p>
<p>After a two-year break being a Dad, I am looking to return to the industry as a full-stack Javascript engineer.</p>

        <p>I ran two of the eleven teams within a Sky’s ‘Lightweight Services’ initiative to replace legacy CRM systems with a modular, service-based infrastructure serving modern web front-ends.
  The project used the latest agile tools and techniques, with individual teams given the flexibility to self-organise.
  Consequently, in response to a high and on-going support load, I ran one team using Kanban whilst
  the other, entirely development orientated team I ran using using traditional Scrum.</p>
  <p>I was also invited into the CRM-replacement architectural group as a technical expert and as a
  formal facilitator for meetings and workshops.</p>

  I started as a developer on  Vebnet's new version of the 'LifeLens' software platform on which it offers its core customer proposition.
  Through repeated contract extensions my role evolved into an application architect and team lead role with complete end-to-end technical responsibility for:
  <ul>
    <li>content management</li>
    <li>direct customer communications and document production</li>
    <li>exposing mainframe data</li>
  </ul>
  After Standard Life's takeover of Vebnet, much development moved offshore.
  I concluded my contract leading 15 people across one offshore and two onshore teams.

Kraya Ltd. is a web design and support house that was expanding into full-scale development.
They brought me in to help them escape ‘analysis paralysis’ on the architecture and redevelopment of the server-side of a consumer facing ticketing website for their primary customer.
We developed a web-service based approach and investigated appropriate technologies for a fully clustered, large scale deployment.
I supported set-up of the project, both tooling and management methodologies, developed the middleware architecture, and maintained a watching brief through early development.

I was brought in to rescue development of the Marketing Approval Platform (MAP) project.
This aimed to automate the workflow for generating new structured financial products, using a specialist technology, Eclipse RCP.
The existing code had been developed by an inexperienced offshore team.
My role was to support them and their code base through to temporary deployment, and to establish an onshore technical team to produce a more maintainable and flexible successor.
I designed a new application architecture and oversaw development. This new codebase is now rolled out globally.

Incremental Ltd. develops niche products using the Eclipse platform.
I am joint founder of Incremental Ltd., and its principle technical capability.
The company’s core product is ‘Incremental Epic’, a contract management suite for the ship repair sector developed in-house.
Incremental Epic is a three-tier system based on open-source technologies and developed entirely by myself.
The software's unique selling point is customised integration with existing systems.
Please see the <a href="http://www.incremental.eu.com/help/index.htm#screencams">screencams of Epic</a> for an overview.

  Bright Grey sells financial protection products through web, telephone, fax and mail channels.
  This involves complex workflows with multiple interactions between telephony, IT and manual systems.
  I was employed to analyse the operations of the technical support team, and report on ways to improve these.
  I was also asked to investigate flaws and suggest fixes to the business processes.
  The most beneficial of these investigations was the case of ‘lost proposals’ – where incoming applications were simply lost to the systems.
  This was suspected but neither proof nor cause was known.
  I discovered that approximately 2-3% of new business was being affected by this with severe impacts on service levels and customer perception.
  With director-level backing, I introduced procedural changes and technical fixes that guarantee that no proposals are now lost.

  Spektra was an Edinburgh-based software house that focused on e-commerce in the financial sector.
  I alternated between being the technical lead on large, mainly web, development efforts and specialist architectural and ‘evangelical’ assignments.

  I was tasked with defining the business requirements for linking multiple providers’ back-end systems to provide a ‘single customer view’ website.
  This lone consultancy role was expanded to defining the technical specifications of the full ETL process and then to leading the team developing the required middleware.
  The subsequent success of this helped promote Spektra as the principle developer of the website and its distributed fulfilment infrastructure.
  During this time I reprised a role I had previously carried out at Vodafone as the customer’s ‘champion’ during requirements gathering and later in partner negotiations.
  I ended up fulfilling three separate engagements at the client, the final time at the personal request of its IT director.

I was the technical lead on an initiative between Spektra and Oracle to develop and publicise the UK’s first home-grown demonstrator of Oracle’s Trading Community Architecture (TCA).
The TCA is a service offering centred around a highly generic and flexible Oracle database.
Our brief was to tailor this for the financial services market, and to provide a compelling sales case for it.
This required an understanding of the market and our potential customers’ drivers, as well as coping with the relatively tricky technical complexities we encountered.
I led a team of four using ‘extreme programming’ (XP), an agile management methodology, to produce the demonstrator, and then partnered with sales personnel from both Oracle and Spektra to develop the proposition to market.

Spektra sent a six man development team to a customer who could neither define their requirements nor articulate their needs.
I was sent in specifically to drive out requirements when it appeared as if the engagement might fail.
Through a series of workshops and pro-active technology demonstrations, we ultimately secured several man-years of work.

I led a three man team to develop an extranet for the client’s AS400-based systems using Lotus Notes and java.
This was Spektra’s first experience with the AS400 technology and the client’s first exposure to web development.
Consequently the project involved a large amount of research and much cross-training.
The delivered product was specifically designed to allow the client to continue development in-house, and is still in use today.

      <section>
  I started as a PowerBuilder programmer and learnt formal analysis and design skills.
  I received a thorough grounding in database modelling and design before moving into Java.
  I worked my way up through programming to team leading to project management, settling into a regular pattern of 3-6 month engagements alternating between project management and team lead/analysis roles.
   Example Engagement : Messaging and Payment Middleware
   www.vodafone.co.uk
  I led a team developing the messaging middleware for an initiative to link SMS texting with e-mail and the internet.  Time pressures were excessive and the team grew from two to eight developers.  However we delivered on time and thereafter Vodafone invited me to act on their behalf managing other third parties on a variety of projects.  My last role was the managing the last-minute creation of an online credit card payment system, delivered in eight frantic weeks.
