                I was a senior engineer in the 'Engage Me' lab.

            <p>
                I acted as a 'first among equals' within the development
                engineers, responsible for much of the web UI and supporting middleware of Lloyd's Financial Planning
                and Retirement division.
            </p>
            <p>
                I worked hard to share knowledge and to cultivate a collegiate, inclusive environment for technical
                work both within the lab and across the division.  I was continuously active in technical guilds,
                training courses and mentoring apprentices.

                When I took time off my formal career to look after my pre-school kids, I decided to pivot my technical
                orientation from Java enterprise technologies to JavaScript and its burgeoning enterprise ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p>
                I learnt all aspects of this including UI libraries, MVC frameworks, server middleware, databases,
                test frameworks and build tools.
            </p>
            <p>
                I became active in the Open Source community, with
                <a href="https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?author=numical&from=2016-01-01&to=2022-10-30">nearly 30 million downloads</a>,

            <p>I ran two of the eleven teams within a Sky’s ‘Lightweight Services’ initiative to replace legacy CRM
                systems with
                a modular, service-based infrastructure serving modern web front-ends.</p>
            <p>The project used the latest agile tools and techniques, with individual teams given the flexibility to
                self-organise.
                Consequently, in response to a high and on-going support load, I ran one team using Kanban whilst the
                other, entirely
                development orientated team I ran using using traditional Scrum.</p>
            <p>I was also invited into the CRM-replacement architectural group as a technical expert and as a formal
                facilitator for meetings and workshops.  It was an interesting challenge to run contentious two-day
                workshops where I eas the most junior person in the room!

            I started as a developer on Vebnet's new version of the 'LifeLens' software platform on which it offers its
            core customer
            proposition. Through repeated contract extensions my role evolved into an application architect and team
            lead role
            with complete end-to-end technical responsibility for:
            <ul>
                <li>content management</li>
                <li>direct customer communications and document production</li>
                <li>exposing mainframe data</li>
            </ul>
            After Standard Life's takeover of Vebnet, much development moved offshore. I concluded my contract leading
            15 people across
            one offshore and two onshore teams.

            <p>Kraya Ltd. is a web design and support house that was expanding into full-scale development. They brought

                consumer facing
                ticketing website for their primary customer.</p>
            <p> We developed a web-service based approach and investigated appropriate technologies for a fully

                scale deployment. I supported set-up of the project, both tooling and management methodologies,
                developed the middleware
                architecture, and maintained a watching brief through early development.</p>

                <p>The company’s core product was ‘Incremental Epic’, a contract management suite for the ship repair
                    sector developed
                    in-house. Incremental Epic was a three-tier system based on open-source technologies and developed

                    myself. The software's unique selling point was customised integration with existing systems.</p>

            <p>Bright Grey sold financial protection products through web, telephone, fax and mail channels. This
                involved complex
                workflows with multiple interactions between telephony, IT and manual systems. I was employed to analyse
                the operations
                of the technical support team, and report on ways to improve these. I was also asked to investigate
                flaws and suggest
                fixes to the business processes.</p>
            <p> The most beneficial of these investigations was the case of ‘lost proposals’ – where incoming
                applications were simply
                lost to the systems. This was suspected but neither proof nor cause was known. I discovered that
                approximately
                2-3% of new business was being affected by this with severe impacts on service levels and customer
                perception.
                With director-level backing, I introduced procedural changes and technical fixes that guarantee that no
                proposals
                are now lost.</p>

            Spektra was an Edinburgh-based software house that focused on e-commerce in the financial sector. I
            alternated between being
            the technical lead on large, mainly web, development efforts and specialist architectural and ‘evangelical’
            assignments.

                <p>
                    I was tasked with defining the business requirements for linking multiple providers’ back-end
                    systems to provide a ‘single
                    customer view’ website. This lone consultancy role was expanded to defining the technical
                    specifications of the full ETL process, and then onto leading the team developing the required
                    middleware in a £750 engagement.</p>
                <p>The subsequent success of this helped promote Spektra as the principle developer of the website and
                    its distributed
                    fulfilment infrastructure. During this time I reprised a role I had previously carried out at
                    Vodafone as the
                    customer’s ‘champion’ during requirements gathering and later in partner negotiations.</p>
                <p>I ended up fulfilling three separate engagements at the client, the final time at the personal
                    request of its IT
                    director.

                <p>
                    Spektra sent a six man development team to a customer who could neither define their requirements
                    nor articulate their needs.
                </p>
                <p>I was sent in specifically to drive out requirements when it appeared as if the engagement might
                    fail.</p>
                <p> Through a series of workshops and proactive technology demonstrations, we ultimately secured
                    several man-years
                    of work.

            <p>I started as a PowerBuilder programmer and learnt formal analysis and design skills. I received a
                thorough grounding
                in database modelling and design before moving into Java.</p>
            <p>I worked my way up through programming to team leading to project management, settling into a regular
                pattern of
                3-6 month engagements alternating between project management and team lead/analysis roles.

                and thereafter
                Vodafone invited me to act on their behalf managing other third parties on a variety of projects.</p>
