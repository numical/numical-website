    <h2>Profile
      <a href="#banner"><img src="cv/home.png" alt="return to Contents" /></a>
    </h2>
    <p>I am a rounded, commercially orientated technical architect and team lead with over 20 years experience of the business
      of software development in a wide range of different industries. I have architected systems, led technical development
      teams onshore and offshore, and project managed.</p>
    <p>My core technical skills are enterprise open-source technologies in JavaScript and Java. I have applied these to all
      levels of the technical stack from User Interface to Database and under project management methodologies ranging from
      waterfall, through DSDM to agile approaches such as Scrum and XP.</p>
    <p>In addition to my technical skills, I regard as core competences the soft skills of listening hard, communicating well,
      and motivating others. I work particularly well at the interface between business and technology. My principle concern
      is delivery.</p>
    <p>After a two-year break being a Dad, I am looking to return to the industry as a full-stack Javascript engineer, a role
      I consider particularly exciting at the moment.</p>

      <section>
        <p>When I took time off my formal career to look after my pre-school kids, I decided to pivot my technical orientation
          from Java enterprise technologies to JavaScript and its burgeoning enterprise ecosystem. I have been learning all
          aspects of this including MVC frameworks, server middleware, databases, test frameworks and build tools. To ensure
          I practised the techniques as well as learn the technologies I carried out various projects:
          <div class="example_engagement">
            <p>Open Source Software, <a href="https://github.com/numical">GitHub</a></p>

            <p>
              My main focus has been a test-bed and technology demonstrator,
              <a href="https://www.impossiblefish.com">impossiblefish.com</a>. Through a series of iterations, I have explored
              such concepts as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API">WebSockets</a>,
              <a href="http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/UsageWithReact.html">React/Redux</a> and
              <a href="https://karma-runner.github.io/1.0/index.html">Karma testing</a>; more detail is given in the website
              documentation.
            </p>
            <p>My work here also lead to my developing <a href="https://github.com/numical/script-ext-html-webpack-plugin">two</a>              <a href="https://github.com/numical/style-ext-html-webpack-plugin">plugins</a> for the popular <a href="https://webpack.github.io/docs/">Webpack</a>              build tool which are each downloaded a few hundred times a month.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="example_engagement">
            <p>Policy Renewal Forecaster, <a href="http://www.aquilainsight.com">Aquila Insight</a></p>
            <p>This was a paid engagement for an old client to produce a trial feature for their data analytics suite.</p>
            <p>The deliverable was a node-based daemon service that accepted requests requiring intensive data processing, spun
              up child processes to deal with the request, then asynchronously notified the client via email and html.</p>
            <p>The service was incorporated in Aquila's software suite.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="example_engagement">
            <p>Mongo University,
              <a href="https://university.mongodb.com/"></a>
            </p>
            <p>
              I completed several online training courses to gain familiarity with JavaScript technologies across the development stack.
              My 'goto' training resource is <a href="https://frontendmasters.com">FrontEnd Masters</a>.</p>
            <p>One of the most interesting other courses I carried out was <a href="https://university.mongodb.com/courses/10gen/M101JS/2014_Aug/syllabus">MongoDB for Node.js Developers</a>              for which I am pleased to report I scored 90% :).

        <p>I ran two of the eleven teams within a Sky’s ‘Lightweight Services’ initiative to replace legacy CRM systems with
          a modular, service-based infrastructure serving modern web front-ends.</p>
        <p>The project used the latest agile tools and techniques, with individual teams given the flexibility to self-organise.
          Consequently, in response to a high and on-going support load, I ran one team using Kanban whilst the other, entirely
          development orientated team I ran using using traditional Scrum.</p>
        <p>I was also invited into the CRM-replacement architectural group as a technical expert and as a formal facilitator
          for meetings and workshops.</p>

        I started as a developer on Vebnet's new version of the 'LifeLens' software platform on which it offers its core customer
        proposition. Through repeated contract extensions my role evolved into an application architect and team lead role
        with complete end-to-end technical responsibility for:
        <ul>
          <li>content management</li>
          <li>direct customer communications and document production</li>
          <li>exposing mainframe data</li>
        </ul>
        After Standard Life's takeover of Vebnet, much development moved offshore. I concluded my contract leading 15 people across
        one offshore and two onshore teams.

          ticketing website for their primary customer.</p>
        <p> We developed a web-service based approach and investigated appropriate technologies for a fully clustered, large
          scale deployment. I supported set-up of the project, both tooling and management methodologies, developed the middleware
          architecture, and maintained a watching brief through early development.</p>

        <p>Bright Grey sells financial protection products through web, telephone, fax and mail channels. This involves complex
          workflows with multiple interactions between telephony, IT and manual systems. I was employed to analyse the operations
          of the technical support team, and report on ways to improve these. I was also asked to investigate flaws and suggest
          fixes to the business processes.</p>
        <p> The most beneficial of these investigations was the case of ‘lost proposals’ – where incoming applications were simply
          lost to the systems. This was suspected but neither proof nor cause was known. I discovered that approximately
          2-3% of new business was being affected by this with severe impacts on service levels and customer perception.
          With director-level backing, I introduced procedural changes and technical fixes that guarantee that no proposals
          are now lost.</p>

        Spektra was an Edinburgh-based software house that focused on e-commerce in the financial sector. I alternated between being
        the technical lead on large, mainly web, development efforts and specialist architectural and ‘evangelical’ assignments.

            I was tasked with defining the business requirements for linking multiple providers’ back-end systems to provide a ‘single
            customer view’ website. This lone consultancy role was expanded to defining the technical specifications of the
            full ETL process and then to leading the team developing the required middleware.</p>
          <p>The subsequent success of this helped promote Spektra as the principle developer of the website and its distributed
            fulfilment infrastructure. During this time I reprised a role I had previously carried out at Vodafone as the
            customer’s ‘champion’ during requirements gathering and later in partner negotiations.</p>
          <p>I ended up fulfilling three separate engagements at the client, the final time at the personal request of its IT
            director.

            I was the technical lead on an initiative between Spektra and Oracle to develop and publicise the UK’s first home-grown demonstrator
            of Oracle’s Trading Community Architecture (TCA).The TCA is a service offering centred around a highly generic
            and flexible Oracle database.</p>
          <p>Our brief was to tailor this for the financial services market, and to provide a compelling sales case for it.
            This required an understanding of the market and our potential customers’ drivers, as well as coping with the
            relatively tricky technical complexities we encountered.</p>
          <p>I led a team of four using ‘extreme programming’ (XP), an agile management methodology, to produce the demonstrator,
            and then partnered with sales personnel from both Oracle and Spektra to develop the proposition to market.

          <p>
            Spektra sent a six man development team to a customer who could neither define their requirements nor articulate their needs.
          </p>
          <p>I was sent in specifically to drive out requirements when it appeared as if the engagement might fail.</p>
          <p> Through a series of workshops and pro-active technology demonstrations, we ultimately secured several man-years
            of work.

        <p>I started as a PowerBuilder programmer and learnt formal analysis and design skills. I received a thorough grounding
          in database modelling and design before moving into Java.</p>
        <p>I worked my way up through programming to team leading to project management, settling into a regular pattern of
          3-6 month engagements alternating between project management and team lead/analysis roles.

        <p> I led a team developing the messaging middleware for an initiative to link SMS texting with e-mail and the internet.</p>
        Time pressures were excessive and the team grew from two to eight developers. However we delivered on time and thereafter
        Vodafone invited me to act on their behalf managing other third parties on a variety of projects.</p>
        <p>My last role was the managing the last-minute creation of an online credit card payment system, delivered in eight
          frantic weeks.</p>
